# Azure IoT Hands On Labs

## Overview

This hands-on lab demonstrates what is involved in connecting a physical custom device up to Azure IoT Hub, to both display the telemetry data sent from the device, but also demonstrate management of the device through that portal.  Additionally, we show you how to do simple "real time analytics" with Azure Stream Analytics and sending commands back to the device.
